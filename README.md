# This is a dotfile configuration for i3 on linux mint to make it look like hyprland (for DEBIAN ONLY)

It needs to be fully tested on mint.

This dotfile includes the eww config.

In order to make the .sh executable you need to make this command :


'chmod +x ~/dotfiles/install.sh'

'chmod +x ~/dotfiles/graphic.sh'

'chmod +x ~/dotfiles/ulauncher.sh'

## Remember, if you add ulauncher, also add it on the exec.conf file to start it everytime

In order to use that you need to uncomments some lines in the installation script.

>The dotfile is fully made in italian (my native languadge).
