# This is a dotfile configuration for Linux Mint to make it look like Hyprland

## It includes the WM i3 for its customisation

>DEBIAN ONLY

# It needs to be fully tested on mint.

In order to make the .sh executable you need to make this command :

## For the complete install script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FX-88/dotfiles.git
```

```bash
cd dotfiles
```

```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
```

```bash
./install.sh
```

### Remember, if you add ulauncher, also add it on the exec.conf file to start it everytime

In order to use that you need to uncomments some lines in the installation script.

>This dotfile includes the eww config. (it need to be enabled on the complete install script by un-commenting its lines)

>Almost every comment line in this dotfile is made in italian (my native languadge), but some of them are in english
