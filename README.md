# This is a dotfile configuration for i3 on linux mint to make it look like hyprland (for debian)

It needs to be fully tested on mint.

This dotfile includes the eww config.

In order to use that you need to uncomments some lines in the installation script.

The dotfile is fully made in italian (my native languadge).
